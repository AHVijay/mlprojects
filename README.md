# 🎯 Student Exam Performance Indicator

This project aims to **predict students' math scores** based on various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course. 📊 By analyzing the dataset and training machine learning models, the project provides insights into how these factors influence student performance.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to understand how students' performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as:
- 👦👧 Gender  
- 🌎 Ethnicity  
- 🎓 Parental level of education  
- 🍱 Lunch type  
- 📚 Test preparation course

It also aims to build a machine learning model to **predict math scores** based on these factors.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977)
- **Description**: The dataset contains **1000 rows and 8 columns**:
  - `gender`: Gender of the student (Male/Female)
  - `race/ethnicity`: Ethnicity of the student (Group A, B, C, D, E)
  - `parental level of education`: Parents' final education level
  - `lunch`: Type of lunch before the test (Standard/Free or Reduced)
  - `test preparation course`: Completion status of the test prep course
  - `math score`: Math test score
  - `reading score`: Reading test score
  - `writing score`: Writing test score

---

## 🔁 Project Workflow

### 1. 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned data, visualized patterns, and gathered insights:
  - ✅ Standard lunch improves performance
  - 👩‍🎓 Female students perform better overall, except in math
  - ✅ Test prep course boosts scores

### 2. 🧼 Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical features with `OneHotEncoder`
- Scaled numerical data with `StandardScaler`
- Split the data into training and testing sets

### 3. 🤖 Model Training
- Trained multiple regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor 🌲
  - XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost
- Evaluated using:
  - MAE, RMSE, and R² Score 📈

### 4. 🚀 Deployment
- Built a Flask web app for predictions
- Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk 🌐
